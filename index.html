<h3>st7735r communication</h3>

afaik, protocol is not spi. it's one that's defined in the datasheet, and simplified here (dirty, and maybe incorrect):
<ul>
    <li>
        ISCL = clock. tick tock!<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        ISDA = two-way data line. tristate when expecting to read, so driver can manipulate the voltage
    </li>
    <li>
        DC = determines if the data being ticktocked onto data line is a command (low) or parameters/other data (high)
    </li>
    <li>
        RES = reset. set to low and bring back up to have the hw in sane state
    </li>
    <li>
        CS = set to low to communicate with the chip. set to high to make the driver deaf to clock
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    as for timings, you have to inspect the datasheet. arduino is slow enough (or at least slow enough with delay(1) in between everything) to communicate without errors

    <h3>how?</h3>
    #1) activate CS, #2) activate DC, #3) for each bit: set value to data line and tick &amp; tock ISCL, #4) tristate data line, #5) deactivate DC, #6) for each expected bit: tick ISCL, read data line value, tock ISCL, #7) deactivate CS if no more communication with the driver is needed

    <b>note!</b> reset was done before, and is not mentioned / visible in the image below

    <h3>image (below) explanation</h3>
    we issue "Read Display Pixel Format" (0x0c or 0b00001100) during 8 clock ticks (last one is longer because arduino goes through "if (i == 0 && expectread) {...") and we get 0b00000110 as result (cmd 0Ch doc says 0b110 = 18-bit/pixel), and as datasheet states at Reset Table -> Interface Pixel Color Format -> After Power On -> 6 (18-Bit/Pixel)
